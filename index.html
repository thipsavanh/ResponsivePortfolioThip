                Hello! I have a background in ophthalmalogy. I have been in this field for the past eight years. During my time in this field, I have encountered numerous patients from a multitude of backgrounds and working with them has been extremely gratifying and worthwhile. However, I want to challenge myself and learn a new skillset. So here I am making my transition to a new career path.
                <br><br>
                I come from a big family, the oldest of four. My mom is one of fifteen, so my extended family is quite large. It is definitely a task to keep up with all of my family, but I love being able to connect to different family members ranging in all ages. Family is of the utmost importance to me. They have been there for me in every stage of my life and for that I am grateful.
                <br><br>
                When I am not spending my time at work or connecting with family, I enjoy baking, reading, or planning my next trip. The great part about having a large family is that they live all over the world and it gives me a built in excuse to travel and visit!
